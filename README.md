# Web Dev I Final Project
## Name: Dirgh Patel
1.	This is the repo from my Web Development 1 class.
2.	Whatever we learned throughout the semester is been displayed in this website.
3.	First step: Download a clone of a perfect P7 repo.
4.	Then we had to replace the default logo to our own customized logo the new logo was made using https://vecteezy.com/editor.
5.	In this repo we had to put multiple pictures for extra credit which was kind of cool.
6.	I also added 2 different and additional articles of CSS elements.
