# Final Project
Web Dev I Final Project
Name: Dirgh Patel
This is the repo from my Web Development 1 class.
Whatever we learned throughout the sementer is been displayed in this website.
First step: Download a clone of a perfect P7 repo.
Then we had to replace the default logo to our own customized logo the new logo was made using https://vecteezy.com/editor.
In this repo we had to put multiple pictures for extracredit which was kind of cool.
I also added 2 different and additional articles of CSS elements.
