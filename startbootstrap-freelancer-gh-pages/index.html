      <h2 class="text-center text-uppercase text-white">The Babadook</h2>
      
        <p> &ensp;&ensp;The Babadook is an incredibly well-made Australian movie by Jennifer Kent, same as her short film “Monster”. The Babadook movie has received great reviews on Rotten Tomatoes with a score of 98% and the best horror movie reward. The Babadook is an interesting movie to watch because man has a different opinion than women after watching the same movie. The Babadook was mentioned in short film “Monster”.  Some part of this movie is based on a real word, as a single mother taking care of her young son after his father died. Becoming a widow, going through the grief from the loss of her husband, and her mental issue is slowly deteriorating. The Babadook is effective at displaying difficulties of single motherhood throughout the movie. </p>
               <p> &ensp;&ensp;Six years ago, when Amelia and his husband, Oskar were going to a hospital for Amelia’s delivery. On the route to the hospital, Oskar died in the car accident. It is very hard to raise a young son without the presence of his father because losing someone from one hand and getting something at the same time Amelia wasn’t mentally stable for this type of life. It is not easy to taking care of her son sending him school, buying his clothes and also managing the financial challenges and maintaining a social life with her family. The single widow Amelia is trying to take care of everything in her hectic life, including his son’s study and his activities.</p>
               <p> &ensp;&ensp;The Babadook is effective at displaying at Samuel behavior changes without his father in his life. In the single motherhood, Amelia was trying to manage all the things in order to maintain their health, wealth and social relationship. The article “Mom – The Designated Worrier” by Judith Shulevitz says that “Sociologists sometimes call the management of familial duties ‘worry work’ and the person who does it the ‘designated worrier’, because you need large resources of emotional energy to stay on top of it all” (Shulevitz).  The household is incomplete without either one parent – In the film “The Babadook” one parent died seven years ago, and another parent is trying to fill that died parent gap. Amelia is a designated worrier because she takes care of herself, maintain a relationship with others and read a book every night for her son Samuel before he goes to bed.  
               <p> &ensp;&ensp;However, a child needs both parents equally. Judith Shulevitz claims that “I wish I could say that fathers and mother worry in equal measure” (Shulevitz). Parents are the creation of God, children learn so many things from both by just watching them and talking with them. In this movie mother, Amelia gives her 50% from her side as a mother but baby Samuel is looking for another 50% form his father too. Because of that, Sam started believing in ghosts and trying to protect his mother. Thus, a Samuel motherhood is effectively displaced by filling up father Oskar gap by his mother Amelie and manage their daily life as well. Amelie is a ‘Designated Worrier’ for Samuel.</p>
               <p> &ensp;&ensp;It is very difficult to rise to a newborn baby by a single mother. There is no one out there who help new mothers to do stuff like to cook food, to clean house, or to take care of a newborn infant. The article “Our ‘Mommy’ Problem” by Heather Havrilesky states that “When I hear someone telling an expectant mother that having a baby will turn her into a new person” (Havrilesky). In the movie, The Babadook Oskar died in a car accident to on the way to the hospital. After her husband’s death, Amelia becomes lonely and alone. After Oskar died, Amelia didn’t have someone who can take care of baby Samuel, herself and house and, she had financial problems, so she had to work in order to pay her bills. Due to taking care of all the responsibilities, Amelia has changed and become carry and responsible for her child.</p>
               <p> &ensp;&ensp;Amelia feels like a different and special person when someone addressing her with “Ma’am” or “lady”. Amelia played a brave role in the movie because she had been doing the same thing over and over for seven years. In addition, being a mother is not just a phrase, it all the hassle and sweat that a mother put into her relationship with children. The article “Our ‘Mommy’ Problem” by Heather Havrilesky notes that “Motherhood is no longer viewed as simply a relationship with your children, a role you play at home and at school, or even a hallowed institution” (Havrilesky). In our household, father knows how to make money and mother know how to spend or handle money. Mother plays the important role in her children’s life as well. In The Babadook movie, Amelia wakes-up in the morning, prepare breakfast for both, drop Samuel to school, go to work, pick up Samuel from work, cook food and windup and clean house, after cleaning the house Amelia reads a book to Samuel every night and repeat for the same day. This is the hassle and effort, mother put to make sure her children get whatever they need. Thus, raising a newborn baby by self without any kind of external support needs lots of hassle and sweat, Jennifer Kent is effective at displaying difficulties of raising children by self, but Amelia does her job perfectly. </p>
               <p> &ensp;&ensp;In The Babadook the motherhood is important for little Samuel because Amelia keeps safe Samuel from outside of the world as well and match Samuel needs like read a book, send him school and give him support when he watches ghost under the bad or in the closet. In the article “Op-Ed: Inconceivable! Detaching Motherhood from Femininity” Nicole Verdes states that, “Women make a multitude of decisions that impact the course of their lives. Some of these decisions are specific to marriage or partnership, career, education and children” (Verdes). A mother has a large responsibility to do, like focus on her house and making sure the food is on the table, to focus on her career if she is working mother, send a child to school, spend some time with partner and it gives positive energy to grip the house duties. In the movie The Babadook, Amelia takes care of her nurse job, take care of his son and manage the food supply at home and also make her son creative by reading a book to him every night. Moreover, it was a tough design to give birth to baby Samuel when his father Oskar died, it was a remarkable design she made. The writer Nicole Verdes states that “It seems that even those of us who choose to remain childfree often keep this decision to ourselves because we understand that there is an unwritten social contract that comes along with being a woman” (Verdes). Some woman would like to be being childfree, just because they have any bad experience from kids or they see any videos some ladies desired to live childfree. In the movie The Babadook, when Amelia and her husband were going to the hospital for Amelia delivery, Oskar died in the car accident on the way to the hospital. In that condition like losing someone in order to get someone kind of situation for her, but Amelia gave birth to Samuel. It shows Amelia’s love for Samuel, this is the motherhood from ‘the horrors of motherhood creeps through the Babadook movie’. </p>
               <p> &ensp;&ensp;However, different kind of people has their own different test. Someone like red color and someone like the black color, it doesn’t mean that one of them is wrong. In the article “The Horrors of Motherhood Creep Through The Babadook”, by Monica Castillo claims that, “Part of what makes Amelia’s breakdown so chilling in how quickly the mother and son are left to their own to fight the Babadook, making it an internal monster both Samuel and Amelia can see and fight against” (Castillo). After reading the book The Babadook, Samuel started reacting different then he was before. Because Amelia was busy with her life and doing multitasking, she got mentally sick after watching her son Samuel. Me as a writer of the essay, I can say that Jenifer Kent successfully shows the Motherhood in the movie and on the other hand, the writer of the article “The Horrors of Motherhood Creep Through The Babadook”, by Monica Castillo claims that Amelia is the worst mother ever. By, watching the bigger picture that why Amelia did that kind of creepy fight with her son, can realize that it was the pain coming out form Amelia’s bottom the heart after seven years by living lonely and missing her died husband Oskar.</p>
               <p> &ensp;&ensp;In conclusion, the movie The Babadook is the best example of the relation between mother and son. It is so hard to share feelings as behalf of the died father for single mother. Raising the newborn baby by self without any external support when your loved one is away from a mother can change mother after it. Also, Amelia keeps safe Samuel form outside of the world and doesn’t fell him lonely, she always entertainment Samuel by reading a book and let him watch a movie. Putting everything together, we can say that the movie The Babadook by, Jenifer Kent did a really good job as a single mother in the movie. Kent successfully shows in the movie how lovely is The Babadook movie motherhood is.</p>

Different fronts (such as Grimond, Baskerville, its Bodoni) take Italian and Italic glyph shapes that are non-interpolation compatible. For instance, the shapes that typically determine the Roman lowercase “n” do not match the contours used to determine the Italic lowercase “n”. instead of interpolating one characteristic to the different, the Italic stem toggles from Italian to Italic shoes, Variable fonts is such a technology which allows complying single font into multiple fonts.
